Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation for this project is to make the beginning of bootcamp a little easier for new students.
- The purpose of this project is to create a study guide to help students during the prework section of bootcamp.
- It will help answer questions students may have about the topics covered in the prework section.
- While making this I learned many valuable things about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.
